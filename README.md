## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive Design

### What I learned

I learned a lot about how to hover over an image. This has been my first challenge. But thanks to the informational material that I got, I managed to solve the problem, and I am happy with my solution.

Also, I reviewed the "position:absolute" along with the related properties like the "transform="translate", which I haven't reviewed in a long time.

Lastly, I was making a mistake when hovering over the image and discovered that the problem was in a misunderstood concept of parent and child elements. Once I corrected that problem by making sure of the relationship with the elements, the problem was corrected.
